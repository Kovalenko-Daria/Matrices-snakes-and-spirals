# Matrices-snakes-and-spirals

## About
Program sorts matrix filled with integer numbers and outputs it in 6 different styles if it is square and in 2 styles if it is not.
***

## Functionality
First, the user enters the dimension of the matrix and the matrix itself into the program (this is accompanied by hints).

If incorrect values were entered, the program terminates with an error message "Error in input".

If a square matrix has been entered, then it is sorted in ascending order and output in six styles: Vertical snake, Horizontal snake, Clockwise spiral to center, Counterclockwise spiral to center, Clockwise spiral from center, Couterclockwise spiral from center.

If a non-quadratic matrix was entered, then it is output in two styles: Vertical snake, Horizontal snake.
